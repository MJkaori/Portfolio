        <p>A Gundam is an advanced, high performance mobile suit, often constructed to be much more powerful than the standard production mobile suits. They are generally equipped with the latest experimental technology available at the time of their construction. The definition of a Gundam varies from one timeline to another. In most series it is used as an acronym to refer to something, however in all but the most recent series these acronyms were derived after the fact and do not appear at any point in the animated works. The protagonist's mobile suit of a series usually carries the name Gundam. The main suit in each series usually sports a mainly white and blue color scheme, with yellow and red accents, and sports at least one pair of yellow or white V-fins on its head.
